His current research explores the role of individual decision makers in shaping observed accounting phenomena. This line of research recognizes two central ideas in behavioral economics. First, individual behavior depends not only on economic incentives and accessible information, but also on individual preferences, abilities, experiences, and other characteristics. Second, the constraints that structure human interactions encompass both formal institutions (e.g., rules, laws, constitutions) and informal institutions (e.g., norms, conventions, rituals). For example, his research demonstrates the long-term impact of early-career experiences on professional conduct in a variety of populations, including corporate managers, audit partners, and financial advisors. His work on top management teams (TMTs) in China explains that listing the TMT names in the order of power in the annual report serves as a ritual in a relational society and that the divergence between the name order and executive compensation reflects nonmarket institutional forces in China.Professor Zuo has received numerous research and teaching awards, including the Cornell-Tsinghua Finance MBA Program Best Teaching Award, the University of Toronto Roger Martin Award for Emerging Leaders, the Journal of Accounting Research Excellence in Refereeing Award, the American Accounting Association FARS Outstanding Discussion Award, the Johnson School Accelerated MBA Core Faculty Award, and the Johnson School Faculty Research Award.

In particular, he considers how alternative management and marketing practices by agribusiness firms affect firm performance and how performance can be improved through the adoption of alternative business structures and strategies. Linkages between firm performance, industry development, and how various firm, spatial, and market factors interact are explicitly considered. He also considers how a better understanding of firm behavior and market conditions leads to more effective agricultural industry development policies. The importance of localized inter-industry linkages and spatial characteristics (market, physical, and sociodemographic) are explicitly considered to better understand the efficacy of place-based development policies and why more general policies can lead to differential outcomes at local levels. Areas of expertise include local & regional food systems performance, cooperative business management & governance, and agricultural rural development.Dr. Schmit’s research involves analyses that not only have a disciplinary focus, but also facilitate effective outreach as a supporting role to his extension programming.

Laboratory tests of these models often make use of eye-tracking data.

She is an expert in the area of marketing hedonic experiences, with a particular focus on wine and gambling. She received her PhD from the University of Iowa in 1997. From 1997-2001, she served as a visiting scholar in the Mind of the Market Lab at the Harvard Business School, where she worked with Gerald Zaltman and Stephen Kosslyn on applications of cognitive neuroscience to marketing, and from 2004 to 2011, she was on the faculty of the UNLV Hotel School, where she taught marketing, marketing research, and a strategic-focused consumer behavior class to undergraduate and graduate hospitality students.  

LaTour's research takes a consumer-psychology perspective toward how marketers should approach branding, experience design, communications, and loyalty programs. She uses both experimental designs and in-depth interview techniques to better understand consumer behavior, fusing macro cultural and micro psychological dimensions to her research. Her major research focus has been on the complexity of human memory. Her research on memory reconstruction was first published in the top consumer psychology journal, Journal of Consumer Research, and won both best paper for research based on a dissertation, as well as best article published in that year (1999), which is a major accomplishment in the discipline. She has published both wine and gambling research in that journal, and her academic research has also appeared in the Journal of Marketing, Journal of Advertising, Journal of Advertising Research, Journal of Business Research, Psychology & Marketing, Journal of Travel Research, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, and Annals of Tourism Research. Her work has also appeared in the general news media, such as the New York Times, USA Today, United In-flight magazine, Las Vegas Review Journal, Las Vegas Sun, and Portland Oregonian. 

Her current research focus is on the development of knowledge with the highly ambiguous perceptual experienced product of wine; how cross-sensory learning methods can be employed to enhance consumer learning; sensory aspects of branding and brand knowledge representation; and what strategies or knowledge  experts (i.e., masters) use to assess their own  tasting experiences. As a means to better understand the nature of expertise, she began her own wine learning journey. In 2011, she received her certified sommelier diploma from the International Sommelier Guild, her sommelier certification from the Court of Master Sommeliers, and Certified Wine Specialist recognition from the Society of Wine Educators. She is currently a student in the Master of Wine program offered through the Institute of Masters of Wine and is studying for her MW, considered to be the highest level of business and wine knowledge in the industry. She has been developing a case-based wine marketing class and is working on several cases and research articles in this area. 

LaTour has also worked with a number of consulting companies, such as Experience Engineering and Olson Zaltman Associates, with clients that include Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Disney, World Bank, Las Vegas Sands, and Yum!

Jacob holds a BA (valedictorian) and MA (summa cum laude) in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley.

Jacob's research falls broadly under the umbrella of socially sustainable operations. His work is informed by the observation that a firm who views social sustainability as an opportunity to innovate can sometimes ""do well by doing good."" In such situations, the firm endogenously adopts a more social focus while improving profits or decreasing costs, creating a win-win situation for disparate stakeholders. In this way, social outcomes improve without external impetus (e.g. government intervention) or appealing to multiple conflicting objectives (e.g. non-monetary). Jacob solves such problems using a variety of methodologies including mechanism design, stochastic dominance, experimental design, and empirical estimation. Recently, Jacob has been investigating problems related to social sustainability in agricultural value chains, with a particular focus on coffee value chains. This work forms the basis of Jacob's popular course, The Business of Coffee: From Farm to Cup.

He applies economic theory to study welfare implications of allocation mechanisms like auctions or platforms in two-sided economies with prices. In addition, he is interested in the strategic effects of lying and misrepresentation in these markets. While his research primarily focuses on high-skill labor markets, his analyses extend to questions of industrial organization and entrepreneurship.In his work, Professor Jungbauer shows that wage competition in high-skill labor markets may result in an inefficient allocation of workers if firms hiring quotas are sufficiently different. He also establishes that firms may opt to delegate their bidding for different vacant positions to agents within or outside the firm as they navigate the optimal trade-off between commitment and market power. Currently, he analyzes how strategic misrepresentation such as resume padding or odometer fraud affects market outcomes.     While his work in market design first and foremost concerns specialist labor markets, he is similarly interested in other bilateral coordination problems with and without prices. One of his projects, for instance, deals with the importance of referrals for the reputation of specialists and the resulting appeal for organizations in markets in which matching is important.In another line of research, he analyzes the optimal branding strategy of firms that sell vertically differentiated product lines. Professor Jungbauer shows that consumers’ brand sensitivity affects the optimal firm policy in a non-monotonic way. Moreover, his work offers an explanation why we see firms implement different branding approaches successfully in one and the same market.His previous work in economic theory critically reviews the literature of games under fundamental uncertainty and suggests an alternative benchmark approach mirroring the concept of rationalizable strategies under risk.Professor Jungbauer teaches the Business Strategy core module at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University in the 2-year MBA program as well as the MBA/FMBA Cornell-Tsinghua dual-degree program.

In another project, he analyzes the connection between the sharing of user data across websites and targeted advertising to understand the influence of ad exchanges in the current advertising ecosystem.In addition, he works on topics in behavioral economics, focusing on biases in decision-making and the formation of social preferences. In one of his studies, he investigates how beliefs about the role of luck for economic success are shaped by people's own experiences. Other research of his in this area addresses the effect of perceived inequality of opportunity on inequality acceptance.During his graduate studies, Marcel taught sessions for various classes in economics, including Intermediate Microeconomics and Principles of Economics to students pursuing either an economics or business degree. At Johnson, he is teaching the Business Strategy core module for full-time MBA students.",Assistant,Cornell,"['his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he']",Male

strategy-and-business-economics,Michael Waldman,https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/mw46/,Charles H. Dyson Professor of Management,"Professor Michael Waldman, the Charles H. Dyson Professor of Management and professor of economics, has served on the faculty of the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University since 1991. He is widely recognized as one of his field's top researchers in the area of applied microeconomic theory, where his main fields of interest are industrial organization, labor economics, and organizational economics. In these areas, he is best known for his work on learning and signaling in labor markets, the operation of durable goods markets, and the strategic use of tying and bundling in product markets.

In addition to his work in industrial organization, labor economics, and organizational economics, Waldman has also conducted research on a diverse set of topics including the role of expectational shocks in business cycle fluctuations, the role of tied transfers in family and government decision making, how the theory of natural selection can explain systematic errors in decision making, and the ramifications of limitedly rational behavior for market outcomes.

Waldman has published in many of the top journals in economics, including the American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Review of Economic Studies, Economic Journal, Rand Journal of Economics, Journal of Law and Economics, Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, Journal of Economic Perspectives, and Journal of Labor Economics. He has also published a number of book chapters in highly regarded outlets, including chapters in the Handbook of Labor Economics, The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, the American Bar Association's Issues in Competition Law and Policy, and the Handbook of Organizational Economics.

In 2003, Waldman was the recipient of the Johnson Faculty Research Award. In 2008 he, along with coauthors Dennis W. Carlton and Joshua Gans, won the Robert F. Lanzillotti Prize for the Best Paper in Antitrust Economics presented at the 2008 International Industrial Organization Conference. In 2017 he, along with coauthor Jin-Hyuk Kim, won the RERCI Best Paper Award for the best paper published in the Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues during 2015-2016. He has also received honors for his teaching including being nominated in 2010 for the School's Apple Teaching Award, receiving the AMBA Class of 2017 Core Faculty Teaching Award, and receiving the Gravitas Teaching Award from the Cornell-Tsinghua Dual Degree MBA Program Class of 2017. 

Waldman received a Bachelor of Science in economics from MIT in 1977 and a PhD from the economics department at the University of Pennsylvania in 1982. Following a post-doctoral position at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1982-83, he was hired by the university as assistant professor in the department of economics. He was promoted by UCLA to associate professor with tenure in 1989. In 1991, he moved to Johnson as a full professor of economics. He was named to the Charles H. Dyson Chair in Management in 1997. From 2011 to 2015 Waldman's appointment at Cornell also included membership in the university's department of economics. Waldman has also visited Yale's School of Organization and Management and Chicago's Graduate School of Business, where he was the John M. Olin Visiting Professor during the 1997-98 academic year.

Waldman is listed in both the 3rd and 4th editions of Who's Who in Economics and in various editions of Marquis Who's Who in America, Marquis Who's Who in the World, Marquis Who's Who in Science and Engineering, and Marquis Who's Who in American Education. 

During his 27 years at Cornell, Waldman has served both Johnson and the university in numerous capacities. He has chaired three different MBA curriculum reviews and has served as the chair of Johnson's Faculty Policy Committee multiple times. In October 2008, Waldman began a four-year term as director of the Institute for the Advancement of Economics at Cornell. He was appointed by then Acting Provost David Harris to lead the council in its work to improve and raise the profile of the economics discipline university-wide. During the 2009-2010 academic year Provost Kent Fuchs appointed Waldman to the university's Strategic Planning Advisory Council. This was an 8 member committee consisting of faculty drawn from the various colleges at Cornell. The committee drafted a long-term strategic plan for the university that identified the goals, strategies, tactics, and metrics that will define the Cornell of the future. During the 2010-2011 academic year Provost Fuchs appointed Waldman to be the chair of a university-wide Economics Reorganization Committee, which had the charge of formulating a plan for reorganizing and improving the economics community at Cornell. The university implemented the committee's plan on July 1, 2011.  

In service to the discipline of economics and related areas, Waldman served as a co-editor at the Journal of Economic Perspectives from 2000 to 2006, served as an associate editor at the Quarterly Journal of Economics from 2000 to 2014, and since 2009 he has been an editor at the Journal of Labor Economics. He was also a member in 2004 of the American Economics Association Program Committee, in 2009 and 2013 a member of the International Industrial Organization Conference Program Committee, in 2013 a member of the Society of Labor Economists Program Committee, and in 2013 and 2017 a member of the (First and Second) Scientific Committee of the Product Lifetimes and the Environment Conference. 

Waldman has also explored whether the exploding growth in autism diagnosis rates over the last few decades can be partially explained by the existence of an environmental trigger for autism that has become more prevalent over time. He is the lead author of ""Autism Prevalence and Precipitation Rates in California, Oregon, and Washington Counties,"" which appears in the November 2008 issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. This paper provides evidence consistent with the existence of an important environmental trigger for autism among genetically vulnerable children that is positively associated with precipitation. He is also the lead author of the 2006 National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper, titled ""Does Television Cause Autism?,"" and the 2012 National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper, titled ""Positive and Negative Mental Health Consequences of Early Childhood Television Watching."" These papers provide evidence consistent with the specific environmental trigger being early childhood television viewing. Waldman plans to continue conducting research on this topic.",Full,Cornell,"['he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he']",Male

Professor Wolfolds has spent time working at both the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors prior to attending graduate school.Professor Wolfolds' research examines the interaction between for-profit and non-profit organizations in industries where they coexist. While non-profits may want to differentiate themselves when faced with additional non-profit competition, it is unclear whether they would want to differentiate themselves or converge towards for-profit competitors. Her research addresses this issue by considering the different financing models, human resource systems, and objectives of non-profit organizations, as compared to for-profits, in the mixed industry of microfinance. Her recent research also examines issues surrounding financial exclusion in the U.S.Professor Wolfolds was awarded a grant by the Strategic Research Foundation to further pursue her dissertation research.",Assistant,Cornell,"['she', 'her', 'her', 'her', 'her']",Female
