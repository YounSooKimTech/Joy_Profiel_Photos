Sterling joined Columbia Business School in 2023 as the Katherine Phillips Associate Professor of Business in the Management Division. Adina’s research advances an understanding of how inequality persists in labor markets and workplaces, despite the efforts of many leaders to create fair and equitable organizations.  In particular, her work demonstrates the various ways labor markets and hiring processes lead societal inequalities to be maintained and reinforced. For example, her work indicates how organizational behaviors such as employee turnover are not only affected by internal factors within organizations (such as employee satisfaction), but factors outside of organizations such as proximity to reliable transportation. These societal factors often cut across racial, class, and gender lines. Her research has been published in numerous top management journals (e.g., Administrative Science Quarterly, Management Science, Organization Science) and science journals (e.g., PNAS), as well as covered by many media outlets (e.g., the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Insider, and Fast Company).
In 2018, Adina founded the Equity by Design Lab (EBDL) while she was at Stanford University. As director of the lab she works with doctoral students, postdocs, and pre-doctoral students to work on solving problems related to workplace and labor market inequality. Researchers in the EBDL use a mix of methods, including archival data analyses, longitudinal surveys, interviews, field and laboratory experiments and computational techniques, to uncover mechanisms generating inequality that are often hidden from view. To learn how to address these inequalities, she creates academic and industry partnerships that focus on the ways workplace inequality can be reduced.
Adina has taught MBA, PhD, executive, and  undergraduate courses, as well as consulted and trained employees at companies including at firms in high tech, venture capital, and law. While at Stanford she developed a very popular MBA elective titled, Equity by Design: How to Build Diverse and Inclusive Organizations. In her teaching she uses a ‘bench-to-classroom’ approach that actively integrates her own academic research and that of other scholars on hiring, promotions, evaluation, and networks to help students design organizations more equitably. Pedagogically, she develops new frameworks (e.g., “Go to the MAT: Merit, Accountability, Transparency”), publishes scholarly translation articles (e.g., Harvard Business Review), and create experiential exercises, to enhance students’ learning across diverse learning modes.
Prior to getting a PhD, Adina worked for five years at Procter and Gamble as a senior engineer, working on the development of consumer products. She received her PhD from Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Organization and Management in 2011.

He applies economic theory to study welfare implications of allocation mechanisms like auctions or platforms in two-sided economies with prices. In addition, he is interested in the strategic effects of lying and misrepresentation in these markets. While his research primarily focuses on high-skill labor markets, his analyses extend to questions of industrial organization and entrepreneurship.In his work, Professor Jungbauer shows that wage competition in high-skill labor markets may result in an inefficient allocation of workers if firms hiring quotas are sufficiently different. He also establishes that firms may opt to delegate their bidding for different vacant positions to agents within or outside the firm as they navigate the optimal trade-off between commitment and market power. Currently, he analyzes how strategic misrepresentation such as resume padding or odometer fraud affects market outcomes.     While his work in market design first and foremost concerns specialist labor markets, he is similarly interested in other bilateral coordination problems with and without prices. One of his projects, for instance, deals with the importance of referrals for the reputation of specialists and the resulting appeal for organizations in markets in which matching is important.In another line of research, he analyzes the optimal branding strategy of firms that sell vertically differentiated product lines. Professor Jungbauer shows that consumers’ brand sensitivity affects the optimal firm policy in a non-monotonic way. Moreover, his work offers an explanation why we see firms implement different branding approaches successfully in one and the same market.His previous work in economic theory critically reviews the literature of games under fundamental uncertainty and suggests an alternative benchmark approach mirroring the concept of rationalizable strategies under risk.Professor Jungbauer teaches the Business Strategy core module at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University in the 2-year MBA program as well as the MBA/FMBA Cornell-Tsinghua dual-degree program.

Dyson Professor of Management and professor of economics, has served on the faculty of the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University since 1991. He is widely recognized as one of his field's top researchers in the area of applied microeconomic theory, where his main fields of interest are industrial organization, labor economics, and organizational economics. In these areas, he is best known for his work on learning and signaling in labor markets, the operation of durable goods markets, and the strategic use of tying and bundling in product markets.

In addition to his work in industrial organization, labor economics, and organizational economics, Waldman has also conducted research on a diverse set of topics including the role of expectational shocks in business cycle fluctuations, the role of tied transfers in family and government decision making, how the theory of natural selection can explain systematic errors in decision making, and the ramifications of limitedly rational behavior for market outcomes.

Waldman has published in many of the top journals in economics, including the American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Review of Economic Studies, Economic Journal, Rand Journal of Economics, Journal of Law and Economics, Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, Journal of Economic Perspectives, and Journal of Labor Economics. He has also published a number of book chapters in highly regarded outlets, including chapters in the Handbook of Labor Economics, The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, the American Bar Association's Issues in Competition Law and Policy, and the Handbook of Organizational Economics.

In 2003, Waldman was the recipient of the Johnson Faculty Research Award. In 2008 he, along with coauthors Dennis W. Carlton and Joshua Gans, won the Robert F. Lanzillotti Prize for the Best Paper in Antitrust Economics presented at the 2008 International Industrial Organization Conference. In 2017 he, along with coauthor Jin-Hyuk Kim, won the RERCI Best Paper Award for the best paper published in the Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues during 2015-2016. He has also received honors for his teaching including being nominated in 2010 for the School's Apple Teaching Award, receiving the AMBA Class of 2017 Core Faculty Teaching Award, and receiving the Gravitas Teaching Award from the Cornell-Tsinghua Dual Degree MBA Program Class of 2017. 

Waldman received a Bachelor of Science in economics from MIT in 1977 and a PhD from the economics department at the University of Pennsylvania in 1982. Following a post-doctoral position at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1982-83, he was hired by the university as assistant professor in the department of economics. He was promoted by UCLA to associate professor with tenure in 1989. In 1991, he moved to Johnson as a full professor of economics. He was named to the Charles H. Dyson Chair in Management in 1997. From 2011 to 2015 Waldman's appointment at Cornell also included membership in the university's department of economics. Waldman has also visited Yale's School of Organization and Management and Chicago's Graduate School of Business, where he was the John M. Olin Visiting Professor during the 1997-98 academic year.

Waldman is listed in both the 3rd and 4th editions of Who's Who in Economics and in various editions of Marquis Who's Who in America, Marquis Who's Who in the World, Marquis Who's Who in Science and Engineering, and Marquis Who's Who in American Education. 

During his 27 years at Cornell, Waldman has served both Johnson and the university in numerous capacities. He has chaired three different MBA curriculum reviews and has served as the chair of Johnson's Faculty Policy Committee multiple times. In October 2008, Waldman began a four-year term as director of the Institute for the Advancement of Economics at Cornell. He was appointed by then Acting Provost David Harris to lead the council in its work to improve and raise the profile of the economics discipline university-wide. During the 2009-2010 academic year Provost Kent Fuchs appointed Waldman to the university's Strategic Planning Advisory Council. This was an 8 member committee consisting of faculty drawn from the various colleges at Cornell. The committee drafted a long-term strategic plan for the university that identified the goals, strategies, tactics, and metrics that will define the Cornell of the future. During the 2010-2011 academic year Provost Fuchs appointed Waldman to be the chair of a university-wide Economics Reorganization Committee, which had the charge of formulating a plan for reorganizing and improving the economics community at Cornell. The university implemented the committee's plan on July 1, 2011.  

In service to the discipline of economics and related areas, Waldman served as a co-editor at the Journal of Economic Perspectives from 2000 to 2006, served as an associate editor at the Quarterly Journal of Economics from 2000 to 2014, and since 2009 he has been an editor at the Journal of Labor Economics. He was also a member in 2004 of the American Economics Association Program Committee, in 2009 and 2013 a member of the International Industrial Organization Conference Program Committee, in 2013 a member of the Society of Labor Economists Program Committee, and in 2013 and 2017 a member of the (First and Second) Scientific Committee of the Product Lifetimes and the Environment Conference. 

Waldman has also explored whether the exploding growth in autism diagnosis rates over the last few decades can be partially explained by the existence of an environmental trigger for autism that has become more prevalent over time. He is the lead author of ""Autism Prevalence and Precipitation Rates in California, Oregon, and Washington Counties,"" which appears in the November 2008 issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. This paper provides evidence consistent with the existence of an important environmental trigger for autism among genetically vulnerable children that is positively associated with precipitation. He is also the lead author of the 2006 National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper, titled ""Does Television Cause Autism?,"" and the 2012 National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper, titled ""Positive and Negative Mental Health Consequences of Early Childhood Television Watching."" These papers provide evidence consistent with the specific environmental trigger being early childhood television viewing.

Professor Anand is an expert in digital strategy, media and entertainment strategy, corporate strategy, and organizational change.

His recent book, The Content Trap: A Strategist’s Guide to Digital Change (Random House) examines digital transformation in content industries, with a view to distilling the learnings from a quarter century of change that might inform digital efforts elsewhere. The book has received acclaim for its perspective on strategy and digital transformation, and was named as one of Fast Company’s top ten business books of 2016, Bloomberg’s “Best Books of 2017”, and received the Axiom Best Business Book Award in “Business Theory” (Silver) in 2018.
Professor Anand's papers have shed light on the roles of branding and advertising as vehicles of matching and information, on competition between cable news networks, and on strategies that firms employ to tackle the challenge of weak or insecure property rights. In prior work, he studied the financing of R&D, the structure of technology licensing contracts, and the industrial organization of financial intermediation markets.

Gleitsman Professor of Social Innovation at Harvard Kennedy School, where she is also the founder and faculty chair of the Social Innovation and Change Initiative. She currently teaches the second-year Power and Influence course and previously taught the first-year Leadership and Organizational Behavior (LEAD) course in the MBA program. She also teaches in the doctoral program and in executive education offerings.
Professor Battilana studies the politics of change in organizations and in society. Her research examines the processes by which organizations and individuals initiate and implement changes that diverge from the taken-for-granted norms in a field of activity. Such divergent changes are particularly challenging to implement because they require not only breaking with existing norms, but also convincing others to rally behind the change. Professor Battilana’s research aims to elucidate what it takes to initiate divergent change, and how to succeed in its implementation. To do so, she has developed two streams of research that address divergent change at different levels of analysis. The first focuses on understanding the conditions that enable individuals to initiate and implement divergent change within their organizations. The second examines how organizations themselves can diverge from deeply-seated organizational forms, which, as they become taken-for-granted over time, prescribe the structures and management systems that organizations in a given sector ought to adopt. Studies in this stream reveal the role of hybrid organizing in this process—defined as the activities, structures, processes and meanings by which organizations make sense of and combine multiple organizational forms. Professor Battilana's research focuses on a specific instance of hybrid organizing-social enterprises- that diverge from the established organizational forms of both typical corporations and typical not-for-profits by combining aspects of both at their core. Her work aims to understand how these hybrids can sustainably combine aspects of corporations and not-for-profits at their core and how they can achieve high levels of both social and commercial performance. 
She has articles published in the Academy of Management Annals, Academy of Management Journal, Harvard Business Review, Journal of Business Ethics, Leadership Quarterly M@n@gement, Management Science, Organization, Organization Science, Organization Studies, Research in Organizational Behavior, and Strategic Organization. Her research has been featured in publications like Businessweek, Forbes, Huffington Post, and Stanford Social Innovation Review.

. . . you didn’t cover the supply crisis we are currently facing.
. . . do your ideas apply when dealing with liars?
. . . how to I handle an irrational opponent?
. . . negotiating over Zoom is different than negotiating in person.
. . . how does it apply to getting my patients to take their medicine?
. . . how does the course apply when my negotiation opponent doesn’t have the power to commit to an agreement?
. . . how does the course apply to negotiations with my father, who stills runs the family business (but should retire)?

 
While each comment seems unique, the critiques more broadly highlight the fact that the course was not focused on the participant’s particular context—the circumstances and conditions that surround a negotiation. While providing an overview of core concepts in negotiation, The Game Has Changed also addresses these and other questions and explains how to adapt systematic negotiating frameworks to your specific contexts.
 
Reforming Social Science
Social science research affects all of us. When researchers learned organ donation rates are higher in countries where human organs are automatically available for donation unless you specifically “opt-out” of the system, as opposed to countries like the U.S., where you are required to “opt-in,” more governments started instituting ‘opt-out” donation policies. When scientists found that walking 10,000 steps a day significantly improved health, millions of people began tracking their steps. When organizations allegedly learned that signing before filling out a form, rather than signing at the bottom, created more honesty, they changed their forms. Because social science research often finds its way to the public and affects our behavior, it is critical that data be true, transparent, and trusted.
            I have been connected to one of the most salient episodes of data fabrication in the history of social science – involving the signing first effect alluded to above. I am working on understanding all known social science frauds in this millennium. Social science also struggles with a broader problem, namely the fact that many studies fail to replicate due to faulty research practices that have become common in social science. Most replication failures can be traced back to the original researchers twisting their data to conform to their predictions, rather than from outright fraud. Trying to produce “significant” results, they may run a study multiple times, in a variety of ways, then selectively report the tests that worked and fail to report those that didn’t. The result is the publication of conclusions that do not hold up as accurate. Both problems – outright data fabrication and this reporting bias that shapes results – need to be tackled, so all of us in academia can publish results that are replicable and can help create value in society.
            The last dozen years have witnessed multiple efforts to reform social science research to make it more credible, reproducible, and trusted. I am writing a book on reforming social science, which will provide an account of recent data fabrications, and highlight strategies to move forward to create more credible and impactful scientific research.

Much of Professor Ferreira’s research has focused on how retailers can use algorithms to make better revenue management decisions, including pricing, product display, and assortment planning. She has partnered with online retailers to design new machine learning and optimization algorithms to predict consumer demand and improve decision making, providing theoretical, numerical, and/or experimental evidence that each algorithm performs well in practice. Her work has been awarded or named a finalist for the M&SOM Best Paper Award (twice), M&SOM Best Operations Management Paper in Operations Research Award, M&SOM Practice-Based Research Award, INFORMS Revenue Management & Pricing Section Practice Award (twice), and INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award.
Through her research and experiences, Professor Ferreira has recognized that many algorithms are deployed as decision support tools, providing recommendations to employees to consider in their decision making. This is for good reason: often employees have some knowledge or intuition that the algorithm either doesn’t have access to or does a poor job of incorporating. Ideally, the employee could use their own knowledge to make improvements on the algorithm’s recommendation. However, in practice this has proven to be difficult. Employees equipped with algorithmic recommendations often make errors when trying to combine their intuition with the algorithm; they either discount or adhere to the algorithm too much. In her current line of research, Professor Ferreira seeks to understand the root causes underlying this poor use of algorithmic recommendations and provide advice to managers as to how the potential of this human-algorithm collaboration might be better realized.

In 2017, Frances took a leave of absence from Harvard to serve as Uber's first Senior Vice President of Leadership and Strategy with a mandate to help thousands of employees excel in a context of hyper-growth and an evolution in culture. Her firsthand experience in Silicon Valley gave her a new lens on the urgent topic of trust and informed her viral TED talk on ‘How to build (and rebuild) trust.’ Now viewed by millions, the talk delivers a crash course on stakeholder trust: how to create it, maintain it, and restore it when lost.
Frances has held extensive leadership roles at HBS, including Senior Associate Dean for faculty development and recruiting, for executive education, and faculty chair for the MBA required curriculum. Within each of these roles, Frances led significant change efforts.

David A. Wells Professor of Political Economy
John Leverett Professor in the University
Harvard University
 
Jerry Green is the John Leverett Professor in the University and the David A. Wells Professor of Political Economy in the Department of Economics.
His current research is focused on principles of equity in collective decision making, the use of irrational choice data to evaluate economic well-being, and the revision of beliefs in the presence of logically inconsistent information.
In the 1970s Professor Green developed the theory of rational expectations equilibrium, focusing on the externalities due to observations of events that propagate through the system when agents extract information from prices. He showed that the theory is extremely fragile because equilibria are likely not to exist or, when they do exist, they may be unreasonably sensitive to errors in the data.
Later in the 1970s and continuing through the 1990s, working with Jean-Jacques Laffont, he explored the properties of dominant strategy mechanisms that implement efficient collective outcomes. They characterized the limitations of these mechanisms and examined how they might be improved under Bayesian incentive compatibility or by taking a sample of the population whose responses determine a decision affecting the entire population. He applied the theory of incentives to employment contracts and to general bilateral contracts with uncertainty on both sides of the market.
Professor Green pioneered the study of how changes in the quality of information affect economic outcomes in general equilibrium theory with incomplete futures markets and in two-person games, providing one of the first examples of what are now called “cheap-talk games.""
Outside of pure economic theory, Professor Green wrote on many topics in applied microeconomics, primarily in public finance. His work on taxation explored capital gains, dividend policies of firms, income taxation in inflationary environments, banking and the mortgage market,  inventory accumulation, and the risk analysis of pension plans. He also contributed to corporate finance, writing one of the first papers to use game theoretic methods to model early stage entrepreneurial investment. With Suzanne Scotchmer, he worked on patent policy in dynamic environments.
Over the past 20 year he has worked primarily on theoretical models of behavioral and normative economics. He has written on voting theory, fair division problems in collective decision making, and choice under uncertainty without the independence axiom.
Throughout his career he has been devoted to the teaching of microeconomic theory at the graduate level. His book, coauthored with Andreu Mas-Colell and Michael Whinston, Microeconomic Theory, is the leading textbook used in first-year Ph.D. courses around the world. He was awarded the J.K. Galbraith Prize for graduate teaching.
Professor Green joined the Harvard Economics Department after receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Rochester in 1970. He chaired the Economics Department from 1984 to 1987 and served as Provost of the University from 1992 to 1994.
He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society and has served on its Council and on the Editorial Board of Econometrica.  He is a Fellow of the Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an Erskine Fellow of the University of Canterbury (New Zealand), an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College (Cambridge University).

He is an expert on leadership, strategy, and organizational issues in firms. His recent work explores leadership and strategic challenges for building high growth organizations in turbulent markets. Some of his prior work has focused on the enablers and implications of within-firm and inter-firm collaboration. He has looked at both when and how firms should leverage greater connectivity within and across their boundaries to enhance performance.   Professor Gulati is the former Chair of Harvard Business School’s Advanced Management Program. He has directed several executive education programs on such topics as Building and Leading Customer Centric Organizations, Leadership in Turbulent Markets, Managing Strategic Alliances, and Sustaining Competitive Advantage.  He is also active in custom executive education. He has received a number of awards for his teaching including the Best Professor Award for his teaching in the MBA and executive MBA programs at the Kellogg School where he was on the faculty prior to coming to Harvard.
His most recent book, Deep Purpose: The Heart and Soul of High Performance Companies (Harper Collins, 2022) offer a compelling reassessment and defense of purpose as a management ethos, documenting the vast performance gains and social benefits that become possible when firms get purpose right. It was picked to be among the best business books of 2022 by Forbes, Thinkers 50, and the Next Big Idea Club. It also received a bronze medal from the Axiom business books awards.  Based on extensive field research, he shows how deep purpose companies energize their enterprise by inspiring employees and fostering greater loyalty and trust with customers and partners. Purpose is also a compass with which these firms navigate the inevitable tradeoffs across stakeholders more deliberately and effectively and balance their short- and long-term goals. 
His previous book, Principles of Management (Cengage, 2013), is a primer on the fundamentals of management that provides a new overview of the field using contemporary examples and cases. In his book, Reorganize for Resilience: Putting Customers at the Center of Your Organization (Harvard Business Press, 2009), which was a finalist for the George Terry Best Book in Management Award, Professor Gulati explores how ""resilient"" companies—those that prosper both in good times and bad—drive growth and increase profitability by immersing themselves in the lives of their customers. Based on more than a decade of research in a range of industries including manufacturing, retail, professional services, media, information technology, and healthcare, the book uncovers the path to resilience by showing companies how to break down internal barriers that impede action, build bridges across divisions, and create a network of collaborators. His previous book, Managing Network Resources: Alliances, Affiliations, and other Relational Assets (Oxford University Press, 2007), examines the implications of firms’ growing portfolio of inter-firm connections. He demonstrates how firms increasingly are scaling back what they consider to be their core activities, and at the same time expanding their array of offerings to customers by entering into a web of collaborations. He has also co-edited a book on leading sustainable change that looks at how organizations overcome internal barriers to change in embracing sustainability programs and also co-edited two books that focus on the dynamics of competition in emerging technology-intensive industries.   Professor Gulati is the past-President of the Business Policy and Strategy Division at the Academy of Management and an elected fellow of the Strategic Management Society. He was ranked as one of the top ten most cited scholars in Economics and Business over a decade by ISI-Incite.

He has been a Harvard MacArthur Fellow and a Sloan Foundation Fellow. His research has been published in leading journals such as Administrative Science Quarterly, Harvard Business Review, American Journal of Sociology, Strategic Management Journal, Sloan Management Review, Academy of Management Journal, and Organization Science. He has also written for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, strategy+business, and the Financial Times.

Harvard,Regina E. Herzlinger,General Management,Full,Female,Nancy R. McPherson Professor of Business Administration,"['her', 'she']",https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6476,1,1,"Regina E. Herzlinger is the Nancy R. McPherson Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School. She was the first woman to be tenured and chaired at Harvard Business School and serve on many established and start-up corporate health care/medical technology boards. She initiated the courses in non-profit and health care at HBS and was the first faculty member to be selected by the students as their best instructor.
Regina Herzlinger has been named the ""Godmother of consumer-driven health care,"" because of her groundbreaking scholarly articles and books on this subject. She differed from conventional views of health care consumers, who were derogatorily described as non–compliant, illiterate, or patients, as in, “you need to be patient.” Instead, she portrayed them as busy people who are eager and capable of participating in managing their health, with appropriate, relevant, and respectful support.Professor Herzlinger's long-predicted focus on the consumer-driven health care movement has supported the explosion of ambulatory medical centers, wearables, implantable sensors, telehealth, urgent and emergent free-standing care facilities, and the intense interest in health savings and health reimbursement accounts. She anticipates future consumer-driven health plans and delivery systems focused on specific chronic diseases and disabilities. (Regina Herzlinger, Market-Driven Health Care: Who Loses in the Transformation of America's Largest Service Industry. 1997)
Professor Herzlinger’s work focuses on the research and pedagogical activities that can help to create the public and business innovations that will reshape health care systems worldwide so they are increasingly accessible, cost-controlled, and technologically enabled. Because the components of the status quo health care systems—hospitals, pharmaceutical firms, insurers, for example—are oligopolized and uncompetitive (Regina E. Herzlinger, Barak Richman & Kevin Schulman. “Maintaining Health Care Innovations After the Pandemic,” JAMA Network, February 10th, 2023; Regina E. Herzlinger. Who Killed Health Care? America’s $2 Trillion Medical Problem – and the Consumer-Driven Cure. McGraw-Hill, 2007) and the employers and governments that should act as agents for their constituents have been notably ineffective (Regina E. Herzlinger, “In the COVID Era, Why Corporate Benefits Demand CEO, CFO Leadership.” California Management Review, Forthcoming 2023), innovation must be consumer-driven (Regina E. Herzlinger. Consumer-Driven Health Care: Implications for Providers, Payers, and Policymakers. Jossey-Bass, 2004.)
Two current main tranches of Regi’s work are aimed at public policy innovation that will give consumers the two resources they buy to drive innovation – money, so they can reward innovators, and transparency, so they can tell a good innovation from a bad one. Currently, employers and government control the funds used to buy health care and health care transparency is an oxymoronic phrase. HBS research has simulated that giving consumers the funds currently spent by their employers to buy health insurance and requiring them to buy insurance that complies with current requirements, will increase after tax income by $151 billion, taxes by $124 billion, and control health care costs as consumers opt for less health insurance coverage and more income (Regina E. Herzlinger & Barak Richman. Give Employees Cash To Purchase Their Own Health Insurance. Harvard Business Review, December 09, 2020). The improvement in income is most pronounced for lower-income employees. She has devised the components of a health care analogue to the Securities and Exchange Commission, so employees will have the information that will enable them to, finally, evaluate the quality and cost of their purchases can purchase wisely (Regina E. Herzlinger. The U.S. Needs an SEC for Its Health Care System. Bloomberg Opinion, August 20, 2020; Regina Herzlinger & Vonnie Quinn, How the Pandemic caused ‘A Lot of Consumer-Driven Innovation,’ Bloomberg TV, October 2020. She and colleague Richard Boxer recommend a transparency  solution for hospital networks that can help to alleviate the hospital bed shortage  that occurred during the peak of COVID (Regina E. Herzlinger and Richard Boxer, “Transparency As A Solution for COVID-19 Related Hospital Capacity Issues.” Health Affairs, February 18, 2022) ,which is under consideration by the US Congress.
Because success in innovation lies much more with effective implementation than with invention, Regi has also focused on a book (Innovating in Healthcare, Wiley 2024) and related field-based case studies that spell out how to create successful health care innovations and avoid failures. She has taught two popular HBS courses on the subject (Innovating in Health Care and an accompanying Field Course) that have helped to create hundreds of innovative health care firms. In addition, she created a Harvard EdX MOOC, Innovating in Healthcare, that has attracted 70,000-85.000 viewers annually since it was launched in 2015. Many of her students founded billion-dollar innovations and prominent non-profit firms and became leaders in major health corporations. Her forthcoming book Innovating in Healthcare (Wiley, 2024), contains the lessons of her courses.
Professor Herzlinger’s work is virtually unique. It is repeatedly attacked by academics, in and out of Harvard University, and the status quo stakeholders who prefer a system controlled by the government to one driven by consumers, but abetted by the government. Some of them confuse universal health insurance coverage, which she supports, with complete governmental provision of health care. Although her early critiques of holy health care grails -- such as nonprofit hospitals (once depicted as saintly but now widely recognized as greedy as businesses); transparency (consumers were “illiterate”); ACOs (Accountable Care Organizations – integrated health care providers that were to fly in the face of the miserable results achieved in integrations elsewhere in the economy and to provide everything for everybody) – proved accurate.
Professor Herzlinger’s work received this remarkable degree of criticism, likely because she is not only consumer-oriented, but also a woman. But, unlike her colleagues, the public is highly interested in her point of view. Three of her books have been best sellers in their fields and her LinkedIn posts regularly have tens of thousands of views.
She also occasionally likes to have some fun with her writing as in, Love in the Office is Wonderful. Except for CEOs. Working Knowledge, Harvard Business School. February 20, 2020 where she discusses how finding love among your colleagues can be a wonderful thing, and not inevitably career ending. Unless, of course, you are the CEO.
Prof. Herzlinger is a successful medical technology entrepreneur with her husband, an MIT Ph.D. Physicist. Their devices, which they design and manufacture in the U.S., have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. They are working on new ideas and have formed a charity to promulgate education in healthcare innovation.",0.9992,0.162,0.027,0.811

Jachimowicz,Organizational Behavior,Assistant,Male,Assistant Professor of Business Administration,"['his', 'he']",https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1175257,1,0,"Jon M. Jachimowicz is an Assistant Professor of Business Administration in the Organizational Behavior Unit at Harvard Business School, where he teaches the Leadership and Organizational Behavior course (LEAD) in the Required Curriculum. He studies how people pursue their passion for work, and his work reveals that passion is often fundamentally misunderstood. In line with the popular adage that “if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life,” many participants in his studies believe that it is easy to be passionate—but his research shows it is actually quite difficult. Prior literature also commonly assumes passion is something people either have or don’t have, but his research shows that passion in fact varies considerably over time, even from day to day. And most importantly, passion is often positioned as a resource that can address countless challenges, from motivating employees to tackling social issues—but in fact, his research shows that sustaining passion over the long term is its own challenge, and requires proactive effort from individuals, managers, and organizations. In fact, the German word for passion, Leidenschaft, translates to “the ability to endure hardship,” hinting at its contradictory nature. Overall, his research suggests that these misconceptions can create a vicious cycle that impedes the pursuit of passion.
To capture the dynamic nature of passion, he predominantly uses experience sampling methods within organizational contexts, in which people respond to short surveys multiple times per day.

For almost three decades, he has studied entrepreneurship as a means to social and economic development in emerging markets. At HBS since 1993, after obtaining degrees from Princeton and Harvard, he has taught courses on strategy, international business and economic development to undergraduate and graduate students and senior executives.
A summary of his conceptual work on emerging markets appeared in his 2010 co-authored book, Winning in Emerging Markets.  Comparative work on entrepreneurship in China and India appeared in two books based on his personal experiences: Billions in 2008 and a sequel in 2018, Trust.  Recently, he co-edited two collections of essays, one a set of transcripts of original video interviews of iconic entrepreneurial leaders across emerging markets, Leadership to Last, the other most recently, Making Meritocracy, an inter-disciplinary exploration of the roots of meritocracy in China and India, with lessons for entrepreneurship and for much studied societal attributes like dynamism and inequality.
He was named the first director of Harvard’s university-wide Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute in the fall of 2010. The institute rapidly grew to engage over 150 faculty from across Harvard in projects embracing the pure sciences, social sciences, and the humanities, and spanning the region from Afghanistan to Myanmar. A centerpiece of the Institute’s strategy is a deep local presence, anchored through offices in New Delhi and Lahore. During the past decade, he also oversaw HBS activities across South Asia, anchored in Mumbai.
He currently teaches a popular university-wide elective course, Contemporary Developing Countries, where students work in multi-disciplinary teams to devise practical solutions to complex social problems.  The course is part of Harvard’s undergraduate general education core curriculum, and is rare in that it also attracts graduate students from across the university, engaging ‘sophomores to surgeons.’ A free online version on the edX platform, Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies, has been taken by about three quarters of a million students in over 200 countries.

Harvard,Rakesh Khurana,Organizational Behavior,Full,Male,Marvin Bower Professor of Leadership Development,"['his', 'he']",https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6921,1,1,"Rakesh Khurana is the Marvin Bower Professor of Leadership Development at the Harvard Business School. He is also Professor of Sociology at Harvard University, co-Master of Cabot House at Harvard College, and the Danoff Dean of Harvard College. 
Professor Khurana received his B.S. from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and his A.M. (Sociology) and Ph.D. in Organization Behavior from Harvard University. Prior to attending graduate school, he worked as a founding member of Cambridge Technology Partners in Sales and Marketing.
Professor Khurana's research uses a sociological perspective to focus on the processes by which elites and leaders are selected and developed. He has written extensively about the CEO labor market with a particular interest on: the factors that lead to vacancies in the CEO position; the factors that affect the choice of successor; the role of market intermediaries such as executive search firms in CEO search; and the consequences of CEO succession and selection decisions for subsequent firm performance and strategic choices. He has published articles on Corp. Governance in the Harvard Business and Sloan Management Review. His book on the CEO labor market, Searching for a Corporate Savior: The Irrational Quest for Charismatic CEOs (Princeton University Press). The book is an analysis of the labor market for CEOs.
In the book Khurana explains the basic mechanics of the market, how it differs from other labor markets, how it has changed in the past twenty years, and whether it is successful in placing the best candidates in the available jobs. He focuses on the growing tendency of boards of directors to ignore candidates inside their firms and to hire CEOs from outside. He seeks to show that this trend has emerged not because of the intrinsic merits of the “external market,” but because of the rise of investor capitalism and despite evidence that reliance on this market for CEO succession and executive compensation has serious problems that may threaten the viability of firms and the legitimacy of market capitalism.
Khurana's subsequent research grows out of the same interests in the social context of business leadership and the allocation of leadership positions that motivated his research on the CEO labor market. His 2008 book, From Higher Aims to Hired Hands: The Social Transformation of American Business Schools and the Unfulfilled Promise of Management as a Profession (2007: Princeton University Press), chronicles the evolution of management as a profession, with particular focus on the institutional development of the MBA. The focus of this book lies in its direct bearing on the question of how professional management has claimed and received legitimation for its role as the steward of a very substantial proportion of society’s material wealth and resources—a role that has itself been subject to changing interpretations over the decades since the phenomenon of professional management first appeared on the American scene. Guiding questions in this research stream include: Where did our current shareholder-centered, agency-based view of the role of professional management come from—particularly in light of the very different one that underlay the founding of the first professional business schools and the granting to them of a place within the university? How does our current view of the role of the professional manager compare with the way that professional responsibility has traditionally been conceived in the other professions? In view of the way that professional roles have recently been evolving in professions such as law or medicine, do market forces inevitably undermine professional autonomy and standards? What would be the potential benefits and drawbacks of management becoming more like the other professions in its structure and culture than it has been during its history to date? Khurana's work argues that without a re-commitment to the professionalization project, business schools risk devolving into narrow vocation schools and serving largely as a credentialing system, ultimately weakening the legitimacy of MBA programs and contributing to a business culture that garners low trust and low legitimacy in society.
From Higher Aims to Hired Hands received the American Sociological Association's Max Weber Book Award in 2008 for most outstanding contribution to scholarship in the past two years. In 2007, the book was also the Winner of the 2007 Best Professional/Scholarly Publishing Book in Business, Finance and Management, Association of American Publishers.
Khurana has also been working with Dean Nitin Nohria to help legitimate the study of leadership as a multi-disciplinary field. Despite the fact that most business schools have ""leadership"" in their mission, the field is not regarded as a legitimate field of academic study. Khurana and Nohria have co-edited The Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice, a  volume aimed at advancing leadership studies as an academic field of study and scholarship that was  published by Harvard Business Press in 2010 and the Handbook of Leadership Teaching and Pedagogy (with Snook and Nohria). 
The Handbook of Leadership Teaching and Pedagogy received the 2010 Outstanding Leadership Book award by the University of San Diego and the International Leadership Association.
Khurana, Nitin Nohria, and Scott Snook are also co-editors of the forthcoming Handbook of Leadership Teaching and Pedagogy, a volume aimed at examining the pedagogical approaches and theories that undergird existing leadership development and training. The volume will be published by Sage Publications in 2011. Khurana, Nohria and Snook are also co-organizing the fourth annual Harvard Leadership Forum that will focus on developing course modules that integrate the teaching of values in standard organizational behavior and leadership courses. 
Khurana is now working on a new research project examining global leadership and the culture, systems, and organizations that support transnational networks of institutional leadership. 
Khurana's work on the deficiencies of the CEO labor market and his research on business education is regularly featured by the general media such as: Business Week, Fortune, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Newsweek, The Washington Post, CNBC, The Economist, Globe and Mail, The New Yorker, Chief Executive and Corporate Board Member magazine. He has also published opinion-editorials in some of these outlets. He has consulted to corporations and executive search firms to help improve their CEO succession, governance, and executive development practices.

He teaches Business Marketing and Sales in the MBA elective curriculum and Marketing Models in the marketing PhD program. Navid also teaches in an Executive Education program on Sales and Distribution Channels. He has previously taught the Marketing course in the MBA required curriculum. 
Navid is interested in studying organizational buying and selling and the implications of novel data collection and analysis technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) for the practice of business-to-business (B2B) marketing and sales. While the transactional values of B2B and B2C sectors in the US are roughly the same, less than 4% of research in marketing is about the B2B sector. This knowledge gap partially stems from the historical lack of access to detailed purchase and usage data in B2B. The new technologies that provide B2B sellers with detailed usage data that they never had access to before can potentially help sellers create more value for buyers. However, these technologies also raise new questions for B2B sellers: How can they use detailed usage data to provide more value for their clients? What is the value of such data for sellers? How would more data and novel analytics technology affect sales organizations and personnel in B2B markets? How would more detailed usage data affect competition in B2B markets? Navid employs various methodologies to answer these questions (e.g., analytical models, empirical reduced-form models, structural models, online experiments). 
Navid received his PhD in management from Yale School of Management, where he also received an M.Phil. and an MA. He holds an MBA from the University of Tehran, a B.Sc. in civil engineering, and a B.Sc. in applied mathematics. Navid's dissertation won the Alden G.

Professor Moss’s early research focused on economic policy and especially the government’s role as a risk manager. He has authored three books on these subjects: Socializing Security: Progressive-Era Economists and the Origins of American Social Policy (Harvard University Press, 1996), which traces the intellectual and institutional origins of the American welfare state; When All Else Fails: Government as the Ultimate Risk Manager (Harvard University Press, 2002), which explores the government’s pivotal role as a risk manager in policies ranging from limited liability law to federal disaster relief; and A Concise Guide to Macroeconomics: What Managers, Executives, and Students Need to Know (Harvard Business School Press, 2007), a primer on macroeconomics and macroeconomic policy.  He has also authored numerous articles, book chapters, and case studies, mainly in the fields of institutional and policy history, financial history, political economy, and regulation.
One notable article from 2009, “An Ounce of Prevention: Financial Regulation, Moral Hazard, and the End of ‘Too Big to Fail’” (Harvard Magazine, Sept-Oct 2009), grew out of his research on financial regulation for the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel.

Harvard,Jan W. Rivkin,Strategy,Full,Male,C. Roland Christensen Professor of Business Administration,"['his', 'he']",https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6539,1,1,"Jan W. Rivkin is a Professor in the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School. In the past, he has served as Faculty Chair of the MBA Program, Senior Associate Dean for Research, and head of the Strategy Unit. His research, course development, and teaching focus on two topics: business strategy and U.S. competitiveness.
Business strategy.  Rivkin’s business strategy work examines the interactions across functional and product boundaries within a firm – that is, the connections that link marketing, production, logistics, finance, human resource management, and other parts of a firm. His work analyzes, first, how such interactions constrain managerial behavior and, second, how managers use cognitive devices and organizational design to cope with decisions whose ramifications span boundaries.
Rivkin's scholarly work has appeared in journals such as Management Science, Organization Science, the Strategic Management Journal, the Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, and Research Policy. Much of this work uses simulations of complex adaptive systems to examine the theoretical implications of cross-cutting interactions. His empirical work on the topic employs a mix of large-scale statistical studies, field research, and case studies.
Rivkin has taught business strategy in the Advanced Management Program, in the first year of the MBA program, and in a second-year MBA elective that he developed, Advanced Competitive Strategy: Integrating the Enterprise. The elective course aims to improve students’ ability to integrate across the parts of the companies they will manage. A comprehensive description of Advanced Competitive Strategy is available to fellow educators via Harvard Business Publishing.
In support of his strategy teaching and research, Rivkin has completed case studies on Airborne Express, BMG Entertainment, Dell, Delta Air Lines, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Husky Injection Molding Systems, LEGO, Lycos, Microsoft, Ryanair, Whirlpool Corporation, and Yahoo, among others.
U.S. competitiveness.  Rivkin also co-chairs HBS's project on the competitiveness of the United States.  In that role, he has worked with a faculty team to explore steps that leaders--especially business leaders--can take to improve the ability of firms in the U.S. to win in the global marketplace and support American living standards. His work in this domain focuses on (a) how managers choose to locate business activities in the United States or elsewhere and (b) how business leaders can best work with policymakers, nonprofit leaders, educators, and others to bring shared prosperity to America’s cities. In support of his U.S. competitiveness work, Rivkin has developed case studies on Barry-Wehmiller, the Columbus Partnership, the city of Detroit, and Southwire Corporation.
Rivkin received his Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard. Earlier, he studied chemical engineering and public policy at Princeton and obtained a M.Sc. in economics from the London School of Economics on a Marshall Scholarship. Prior to pursuing his doctorate, Rivkin led case teams and managed client relationships at Monitor Company, a strategy consulting firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

She has also taught the second-year MBA course Mastering Strategy Execution, the doctoral course Management Control and Performance Measurement, and teaches various executive programs such as Driving Corporate Performance and Driving Profitable Growth.
Professor Sandino's research examines how organizations use management control systems—systems put in place by managers to ensure the actions and decisions of employees are consistent with the organization’s objectives. She is particularly interested in addressing challenges associated with scaling up businesses. Her research has been focused on introducing management control systems in growing, multiunit organizations (such as retailers, banks, hotels, or restaurant chains). As these organizations grow, founders implement management systems to maintain consistency and achieve economies of scale. But these systems can limit the organization’s flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities and enter new markets. Professor Sandino looks at design choices of management control systems to enable agility: how systems can be designed to empower employees, promote an engaging organizational environment, and nurture their intrinsic motivation to create value.
Professor Sandino’s work has been published in The Accounting Review, the Journal of Accounting and Economics, the Journal of Accounting Research, Management Science, and Contemporary Accounting Research.

Over those early years, we worked daily with Jim, who was very helpful with critical deals at key moments… Jim’s approach makes major differences in significant transactions.” Former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, recently (2018) attested to Jim’s standing in the negotiation field when he wrote ""Given his familiarity with the relevant academic research and extensive experience in high-stakes dealmaking, Jim . . . possesses a deep understanding of complex negotiations…[he] has produced a superb and practical analysis of how to forge worthwhile agreements in complex situations.”  
Since 2001, he has chaired the annual Great Negotiator Award program at Harvard, which has intensively engaged with negotiators such as Richard Holbrooke, James Baker, Lakhdar Brahimi, George Mitchell, Charlene Barshefsky, Juan Santos, Christiana Figueres, and Bruce Wasserstein.
