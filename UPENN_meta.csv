Sylvain Catherine (2022), Keeping Options Open: What Motivates Entrepreneurs?, Journal of Financial Economics.Abstract: Using French administrative data on job-creating entrepreneurs, I estimate a life-cycle model in which risk-averse individuals can start businesses and return to paid employment. Then, I use the dynamic model to value the option of returning to the labor market in case of failure. For new entrepreneurs, this option is worth 6.4 the average net wage in the country, which represented 136,000€ in 2018. This option value is explained by the unobserved heterogeneity in entrepreneurial abilities and the random-walk component of productivity. Estimated unobserved benefits of entrepreneurship represent 38.6% of the average net wage pre-tax per year (some 15% of profits), or 8,250€ in 2018. Unobserved benefits add up to 90,700€ over the average entrepreneurial spell. Together, unobserved benefits and the option value of returning to paid employment explain 42% of firm creations.Sylvain Catherine (2021), Countercyclical Income Risk and Portfolio Choices over the Life-Cycle, Review of Financial Studies.Abstract: I structurally estimate a life-cycle model of portfolio choices that incorporates the relationship between stock market returns and the skewness of idiosyncratic income shocks. The cyclicality of skewness can explain (i) low stock market participation among young households with modest financial wealth and (ii) why the equity share of participants slightly increases until retirement. With an estimated relative risk aversion of 5 and yearly participation cost of $290, the model matches the evolution of wealth, of participation and of the conditional equity share over the life-cycle. Nonetheless, I find that cyclical skewness increases the equity premium by at most 0.5%.Sylvain Catherine, Maxwell Miller, Natasha Sarin (2020), Relaxing Household Liquidity Constraints through Social Security, Journal of Public Economics.Abstract: More than a quarter of working-age households in the United States do not have sufficient savings to cover their expenditures after a month of unemployment. Recent proposals suggest giving workers early access to a small portion of their future Social Security benefits to finance their consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. We empirically analyze their impact. Relying on data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, we build a measure of households' expected time to cash shortfall based on the incidence of COVID-induced unemployment. We show that access to 1% of future benefits allows 75% of households to maintain their current consumption for three months in case of unemployment. We then compare the efficacy of access to Social Security benefits to already legislated approaches, including early access to retirement accounts, stimulus relief checks, and expanded unemployment insurance.Sylvain Catherine, Natasha Sarin, Max Miller, Social Security and Trends in Wealth Inequality.Abstract: Recent influential work finds large increases in inequality in the U.S., based on measures of wealth concentration that notably exclude the value of social insurance programs. This paper revisits this conclusion by incorporating Social Security retirement benefits into measures of wealth inequality. Wealth inequality has not increased in the last three decades when Social Security is accounted for. When discounted at the risk-free rate, real Social Security wealth increased substantially from $5.6 trillion in 1989 to just over $42.0 trillion in 2016. When we adjust for systematic risk coming from the covariance of Social Security returns with the market portfolio, this increase remains sizable, growing from over $4.6 trillion in 1989 to $34.0 trillion in 2016. Consequently, by 2016, Social Security wealth represented 58% of the wealth of the bottom 90% of the wealth distribution. Redistribution through programs like Social Security increases the progressivity of the economy, and it is important that our estimates of wealth concentration reflect this.Sylvain Catherine (Work In Progress), Countercyclical Income Risk and Portfolio Choices: Evidence from Sweden.Abstract: Using Swedish administrative panel data, we show that workers facing higher left-tail income risk when equity markets perform poorly are less likely to participate in the stock market and, conditional on participation, have lower equity shares. We call this measure of income risk “cyclical skewness” and show that it is a better predictor of equity holdings than other income risk measures such as variance, covariance, and countercyclical volatility. In line with theory, our findings are stronger at the beginning of the life-cycle, are not significant for individuals with substantial financial wealth, and are stronger when we focus on permanent income shocks. Finally, within their risky portfolio, workers put less weight on securities generating negative returns when their own income risk increases.Sylvain Catherine (Working), Labor Market Risk and the Private Value of Social Security.Sylvain Catherine, Thomas Chaney, David Thesmar, David Sraer, Zongbo Huang (Under Revision), Quantifying Reduced-Form Evidence on Collateral Constraints (accepted Journal of Finance).Abstract: While a mature literature shows that credit constraints causally affect firm-level investment, this literature provides little guidance to quantify the economic effects implied by these findings. Our paper attempts to fill this gap in two ways. First, we use a structural model of firm dynamics with collateral constraints, and estimate the model to match the firm-level sensitivity of investment to collateral values. We estimate that firms can only pledge about 19% of their collateral value. Second, we embed this model in a general equilibrium framework and estimate that, relative to first-best, collateral constraints are responsible for 11% output losses.

Our model features a novel transmission mechanism from Wall Street to Main Street, as borrower households choose lower leverage and consumption when intermediaries are distressed. The model has financially constrained young and unconstrained middle-aged households in overlapping generations. Young households choose higher leverage and riskier mortgages than the middle-aged, and their consumption is particularly sensitive to credit supply. Relative to a standard model with exogenous credit constraints, the macroeconomic importance of intermediary net worth is magnified through its effects on household leverage, house prices, and consumption demand. The model quantitatively demonstrates how recessions with housing crises differ from those driven only by productivity, and how a growing demand for safe assets replicates many features of the 2000s credit boom and increases the severity of future financial crises.Jules van Binsbergen, William Diamond, Marco Grotteria (2018), Risk Free Interest Rates (Journal of Financial Economics, Jan 2022), Journal of Financial Economics.William Diamond and Nikhil Agarwal (2017), Latent Indices in Assortative Matching Models, Quantitative Economics (best paper award in QE for 2017).

Winston (Wei) Dou’s research focus lies at the intersection of finance, macroeconomics, and econometrics, in particular the impact of economic uncertainty, the role of market imperfection and incompleteness, the interactions of international asset prices and capital flows and their roles in understanding global imbalances, and new econometric methods for analyzing structural models. His articles have appeared in the Journal of Finance, the Annals of Statistics, and Journal of American Statistics Association. His research has received multiple academic awards, and he also received teaching excellence award at the Wharton School.
One of his recent research projects quantitatively and empirically investigates how heightened economic uncertainty affects asset prices and investment. Intuitively speaking, economic uncertainty is the blurriness or randomness of firm-specific economic prospects. Interestingly, he finds that, in the model as in the data, uncertainty is not always fearfully evil as the economy has experienced around the late 2000s financial crisis; in fact, it can sometimes be welcomed and embraced by investors.
He joined Wharton in 2016 as an assistant professor of finance. Previously, he studied financial economics at MIT. He also received another doctoral degree in statistics from Yale University in 2010. He obtained a B.S. in mathematics and another B.S. in economics from Peking University in China.

Daniel Garrett and Ivan T. Ivanov (Under Revision), Gas, Guns, and Governments: Financial Costs of Anti-ESG Policies.Abstract: We study how regulation limiting ESG policies distorts financial market outcomes. In 2021 Texas enacted laws that prohibit municipalities from contracting with banks with certain ESG policies, leading to the exit of five of the largest municipal bond underwriters from the state. Issuers previously reliant on these underwriters face higher uncertainty and borrowing costs since the enactment of the laws. These effects are consistent with deterioration in underwriter competition as issuers face fewer potential underwriters. Texas issuers will incur $300-$500 million in additional interest on the $31.8 billion borrowed during the first eight months following enactment.Daniel Garrett, Andrey Ordin, James Roberts, Juan Carlos Suarez Serrato (2023), Tax Advantages and Imperfect Competition in Auctions for Municipal Bonds, The Review of Economic Studies, 90 (2), pp. 815-851. https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdac035Abstract: We study the interaction between tax advantages for municipal bonds and the market structure of auctions for these bonds. We show that this interaction can limit a bidder’s ability to extract information rents and is a crucial determinant of state and local governments’ borrowing costs. Reduced-form estimates show that increasing the tax advantage by 3 pp lowers mean borrowing costs by 9–10%⁠. We estimate a structural auction model to measure markups and to illustrate and quantify how the interaction between tax policy and bidder strategic behaviour determines the impact of tax advantages on municipal borrowing costs. We use the estimated model to evaluate the efficiency of Obama and Trump administration policies that limit the tax advantage for municipal bonds. Because reductions in the tax advantage inflate bidder markups and depress competition, the resulting increase in municipal borrowing costs more than offsets the tax savings to the government. Finally, we use the model to analyse a recent non-tax regulation that affects entry into municipal bond auctions.Daniel Garrett, Mark Curtis, Kevin Roberts, Eric Ohrn, Juan Carlos Suarez Serrato (Under Revision), Capital Investment and Labor Demand.Abstract: We study how tax policies that lower the cost of capital impact investment and labor demand. Diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimates using conﬁdential US Census Data on manufacturing establishments show that tax policies increased both investment and employment, but did not lead to wage or productivity gains. Using a structural model, we show that the primary eﬀect of the policy was to increase the use of all inputs by lowering overall costs of production. The policy further stimulated production employment due to the complementarity of production labor and capital. Supporting this conclusion, we ﬁnd that investment is greater in plants with lower labor costs. Our results show that recent tax policies that incentivize capital investment do not lead manufacturing plants to replace workers with machines.Daniel Garrett (Under Revision), Conflicts of Interest in Municipal Bond Advising and Underwriting.Abstract: A regulation following from Dodd-Frank prohibits municipal financial advisors from simultaneously acting as municipal bond underwriters. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I test whether this reduction in advisor privileges affects financial advice and bond outcomes. Bonds with potential dual advisor-underwriters see financing costs fall by 11.4 basis points (5.3% of average yield) after the advisor is no longer allowed to underwrite. The decline is concentrated in opaque school district bonds and new money issues. Non-advisors compete for underwriting business more aggressively since they are less likely to face adverse selection after previously conflicted advisors encourage creditworthy borrowers to obtain credit ratings.Daniel Garrett, Eric Ohrn, Juan Carlos Suarez Serrato (2020), Tax Policy and Local Labor Market Behavior, American Economic Review: Insights, 2 (1), pp. 83-100. 10.1257/aeri.20190041Abstract: Since 2002, the US government has encouraged business investment using accelerated depreciation policies that significantly reduce investment costs. We provide the first in-depth analysis of this stimulus on employment and earnings. Our local labor markets approach exploits cross-industry variation in policy generosity interacted with county-level industry location data. This strategy identifies the partial equilibrium effects of accelerated depreciation. Places that experience larger decreases in investment costs see an increase in employment and earnings. In contrast, the policy does not have positive effects on earnings-per-worker. Overall, our findings suggest federal corporate tax policy has large effects on local labor markets.Daniel Garrett and Juan Carlos Suarez Serrato (2019), How Elastic is the Demand for Tax Havens? Evidence from the US Possessions Corporations Tax Credit, AEA Papers and Proceedings, 109, pp. 493-499. 10.1257/pandp.20191044Abstract: Why do some firms adopt certain tax havens and how sensitive is the demand for tax havens? We address these questions by studying how the repeal of Section 936 tax credits affected firms with affiliates in Puerto Rico. We first describe the characteristics of US multinationals that were exposed to Section 936. We then show that the market value of exposed firms decreased after losing access to Section 936, implying that firms could not perfectly substitute to other tax havens. Finally, we find that firms exposed to Section 936 did not respond by expanding their network of tax havens.

Marius Guenzel and Tong Liu, Excess Commitment in R&D.Marius Guenzel, Clint Hamilton, Ulrike Malmendier, CEO Social Preferences and Layoffs.Marius Guenzel, In Too Deep: The Effect of Sunk Costs on Corporate Investment (The Journal of Finance, forthcoming).Abstract: Sunk costs are unrecoverable costs that should not affect decision-making. I provide evidence that firms systematically fail to ignore sunk costs and that this leads to significant investment distortions. In fixed-exchange-ratio stock mergers, aggregate market fluctuations after parties enter into a binding merger agreement induce plausibly exogenous variation in the final acquisition cost. These quasi-random cost shocks strongly predict firms’ commitment to an acquired business following deal completion, with an interquartile cost increase reducing subsequent divestiture rates by 8-9%. Consistent with an intrapersonal sunk cost channel, distortions are concentrated in firm-years in which the acquiring CEO is still in office.Mark Borgschulte, Marius Guenzel, Canyao Liu, Ulrike Malmendier, CEO Stress, Aging, and Death (R&R at The Journal of Finance).Abstract: We assess the long-term effects of managerial stress on aging and mortality. First, we show that exposure to distress shocks during the Great Recession produces visible signs of aging in CEOs. Applying neural-network based machine-learning techniques to pre- and post-distress pictures, we estimate an increase in their so-called apparent age by one year. Second, using data on CEOs since the 1980s, we estimate a 1.2-year decrease in life expectancy after an industry distress shock, but a two-year increase when anti-takeover laws insulate CEOs from market discipline. The estimated health costs are significant, also relative to other known health risks.Marius Guenzel and Ulrike Malmendier (2020), Behavioral Corporate Finance: The Life Cycle of a CEO Career, Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance, September 2020.Abstract: One of the fastest-growing areas of finance research is the study of managerial biases and their implications for firm outcomes. Since the mid-2000s, this strand of behavioral corporate finance has provided theoretical and empirical evidence on the influence of biases in the corporate realm, such as overconfidence, experience effects, and the sunk-cost fallacy. The field has been a leading force in dismantling the argument that traditional economic mechanisms — selection, learning, and market discipline — would suffice to uphold the rational-manager paradigm. Instead, the evidence reveals that behavioral forces exert a significant influence at every stage of a chief executive officer’s (CEO’s) career. First, at the appointment stage, selection does not impede the promotion of behavioral managers. Instead, competitive environments oftentimes promote their advancement, even under value-maximizing selection mechanisms. Second, while at the helm of the company, learning opportunities are limited, since many managerial decisions occur at low frequency, and their causal effects are clouded by self-attribution bias and difficult to disentangle from those of concurrent events. Third, at the dismissal stage, market discipline does not ensure the firing of biased decision-makers as board members themselves are subject to biases in their evaluation of CEOs.
By documenting how biases affect even the most educated and influential decision-makers, such as CEOs, the field has generated important insights into the hard-wiring of biases. Biases do not simply stem from a lack of education, nor are they restricted to low-ability agents. Instead, biases are significant elements of human decision-making at the highest levels of organizations.
An important question for future research is how to limit, in each CEO career phase, the adverse effects of managerial biases. Potential approaches include refining selection mechanisms, designing and implementing corporate repairs, and reshaping corporate governance to account not only for incentive misalignments but also for biased decision-making.

Sasha Indarte, Bad News Bankers: Underwriter Reputation and Contagion in Pre-1914 Sovereign Debt Markets.Abstract: This paper uses new bond-level data on sovereign borrowing and defaults during 1869-1914 to quantify a channel of contagion via banks’ reputation for monitoring borrowers. Concerns over reputation incentivized Britain’s merchant banks (who underwrote sovereign bonds) to monitor and exert influence over sovereigns. Default signaled to investors that a bank was less willing or able to write and support quality issues, indicating that its other bonds may underperform in the future. Consistent with reputation-based contagion, I find that comovement between defaulting and non-defaulting bonds is six times larger when the bonds share an underwriter. To isolate the causal effect of a shared underwriter, I exploit within-country variation in bonds’ underwriters. Testing predictions from a dynamic game where underwriters build a reputation for monitoring, I find further evidence supporting reputation as the mechanism – as opposed to alternative explanations such as wealth effects. These findings highlight that the reputation of intermediaries that monitor and intervene in crises can be a powerful source of contagion unrelated to a borrower’s fundamentals.Sasha Indarte, Moral Hazard versus Liquidity in Household Bankruptcy.Abstract: This paper studies the role of moral hazard and liquidity in driving household bankruptcy. First, I estimate that increases in potential debt forgiveness have a positive, but small, effect on filing using a regression kink design. Second, exploiting quasi-experimental variation in mortgage payment reductions, I estimate that filing is five times more responsive to cash-on-hand than relief generosity. Using a sufficient statistic, I show the estimates imply large consumption-smoothing benefits of bankruptcy for the marginal filer. Finally, I conclude 83% of the filing response to dischargeable debt comes from liquidity effects rather than a moral hazard response to financial incentives.Sasha Indarte, Financial Crises and the Transmission of Monetary Policy to Consumer Credit Markets.Abstract: How does creditor health impact the pass-through of monetary policy to households? Using data on the universe of US credit unions, I document that creditor asset losses increase the sensitivity of consumer credit to monetary policy. Identification exploits plausibly exogenous variation in asset losses and high-frequency identification of monetary policy shocks. Weaker lenders can respond more if they face financial frictions that easing alleviates. The estimates imply constraints on monetary policy become more costly in financial crises featuring creditor asset losses, and that an additional benefit of monetary easing is that it weakens the causal, contractionary effect of asset losses.Sasha Indarte and Gideon Bornstein, The Impact of Social Insurance on Household Debt.Abstract: This paper investigates how the expansion of social insurance affects households’ accumulation of debt. Insurance can reduce reliance on debt by lessening the financial impact of adverse events like illness and job loss. But it can also weaken the motive to self-insure through savings, and households’ improved financial resilience can increase access to credit. Using two quasi experimental research designs, we estimate the causal effect of expanded insurance on household debt, exploiting the staggered expansions of one of the largest US social insurance programs: Medicaid. We find that expanding Medicaid increased credit card borrowing by 2.2%. Decomposing this effect in a model of household borrowing, we show that increased credit supply in response to households’ improved financial resilience fully accounts for this rise in borrowing and contributed to 17% of the total welfare gains of expanding Medicaid.

William Diamond, Tim Landvoigt, German Sanchez Sanchez, Printing Away the Mortgages: Fiscal Inflation and the Post-Covid Housing Boom.William Diamond and Tim Landvoigt, Credit Cycles with Market Based Household Leverage (Journal of Financial Economics, Nov 2022).Abstract: We develop a model in which mortgage leverage available to households depends on the risk bearing capacity of financial intermediaries. Our model features a novel transmission mechanism from Wall Street to Main Street, as borrower households choose lower leverage and consumption when intermediaries are distressed. The model has financially constrained young and unconstrained middle-aged households in overlapping generations. Young households choose higher leverage and riskier mortgages than the middle-aged, and their consumption is particularly sensitive to credit supply. Relative to a standard model with exogenous credit constraints, the macroeconomic importance of intermediary net worth is magnified through its effects on household leverage, house prices, and consumption demand. The model quantitatively demonstrates how recessions with housing crises differ from those driven only by productivity, and how a growing demand for safe assets replicates many features of the 2000s credit boom and increases the severity of future financial crises.Tim Landvoigt, Vadim Elenev, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, A Macroeconomic Model with Financially Constrained Producers and Intermediaries.Abstract: We propose a model that can simultaneously capture the sharp and persistent drop in macro-economic aggregates and the sharp change in credit spreads observed in the U.S. during the Great Recession. The model features financial intermediaries that make long-term defaultable loans to producers and raise short-term debt from savers. Intermediaries are subject to a regulatory equity capital constraint. Policies limiting intermediary leverage redistribute wealth from savers to equity owners of producers and intermediaries. The benefits of lower intermediary leverage for financial stability are offset by the costs from lower output. Current capital requirements are close to optimal.Tim Landvoigt and Juliane Begenau, Financial Regulation in a Quantitative Model of the Modern Banking System.Abstract: How does the shadow banking system respond to changes in the capital regulation of commercial banks? We propose a tractable, quantitative general equilibrium model with regulated and unregulated banks to study the unintended consequences of regulatory policy. Tightening the capital requirement from the status quo creates a safer banking system despite more shadow banking activity. A reduction in aggregate liquidity provision decreases the funding costs of all banks, raising profits and reducing risk-taking incentives. Calibrating the model to data on financial institutions in the U.S., we find the optimal capital requirement is around 15%.Tim Landvoigt, Vadim Elenev, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh (2016), Phasing Out the GSEs, Journal of Monetary Economics, 81, pp. 111-132.Abstract: We develop a new model of the mortgage market where both borrowers and lenders can default. Risk tolerant savers act as intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient borrowers. The government plays a crucial role by providing both mortgage guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government mortgage guarantees lead to more and riskier mortgage originations as well as to high financial sector leverage. Mortgage crises occasionally turn into financial crises and government bailouts due to the fragility of the intermediaries' balance sheets. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee ``crowds in"" the private sector, reduces financial fragility, leads to fewer but safer mortgages, lowers house prices, and raises mortgage and risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector, consumption smoothing improves and aggregate welfare increases. While borrowers are nearly indifferent to a world with or without mortgage guarantees, savers are substantially better off. While aggregate welfare increases, so does wealth inequality.Tim Landvoigt (2016), Housing demand during the boom: the role of expectations and credit constraints, Review of Financial Studies, 30 (6), pp. 1865-1902.Abstract: I use a life-cycle model of housing demand to infer expectations about house prices and home equity requirements for the housing boom of the 2000s from observed household choices. Expectations and credit constraints are separately identified from the intensive and extensive margins of housing demand. The main results are that (1) expected price growth was close to average long-run growth, (2) home equity requirements were lax initially, but tightened after the bust, and (3) subjective uncertainty about future price growth was large. Given the option to default on mortgage debt, greater price uncertainty leads to higher optimal household leverage.Tim Landvoigt and Richard Lowery, Financial Industry Dynamics.Abstract: We develop a dynamic model of entry, exit, and firm quality in the market for issuance and trading of complex financial securities. Firm quality has two dimensions; security production expertise, which creates a positive externality for other firms, and trading expertise, which allows firms to obtain more favorable prices when trading with other firms. We find that markets that have a greater scope for investment in trading expertise (information) also exhibit greater concentration, firm heterogeneity, fragility, and price dispersion.Tim Landvoigt, Monika Piazzesi, Martin Schneider (2015), The Housing Market(s) of San Diego, American Economic Review, 105 (4), pp. 1371-1407.Abstract: This paper uses an assignment model to understand the cross section of house prices within a metro area. Movers' demand for housing is derived from a life-cycle problem with credit market frictions. Equilibrium house prices adjust to assign houses that differ by quality to movers who differ by age, income, and wealth. To quantify the model, we measure distributions of house prices, house qualities, and mover characteristics from micro-data on San Diego County during the 2000s boom. The main result is that cheaper credit for poor households was a major driver of prices, especially at the low end of the market.Tim Landvoigt, Monika Piazzesi, Martin Schneider (2014), Housing assignment with restrictions: theory and evidence from Stanford campus, American Economic Review, 104 (5), pp. 67-72.Abstract: This paper studies housing markets where a subset of houses in a restricted area is available exclusively to a subset of ""eligible"" buyers. An empirical part shows that houses on Stanford campus (available only to faculty) trade at substantial discounts to comparable houses off campus. The theoretical part describes an assignment model with heterogeneous houses and buyers which predicts such discounts if the matchup of quality and buyer pools is sufficiently different inside versus outside the restricted area. The restriction can distort allocations by making eligible buyers choose either higher or lower qualities than ineligible buyers with the same characteristics.

Julia Fonseca and Lu Liu, Mortgage Lock-In, Mobility, and Labor Reallocation.Abstract: We study the impact of rising mortgage rates on mobility and labor reallocation. Using individual-level credit record data and variation in the timing of mortgage origination, we show that a 1 p.p. decline in mortgage rate deltas (Δr), measured as the difference between the mortgage rate locked in at purchase and the current market rate, reduces moving rates by 0.68 p.p, or 9%. This effect is economically meaningful and implies that projected rate increases until 2033 will reduce moving by 25%. Moreover, we show that this relationship is nonlinear: once Δr is high enough, households’ alternative of refinancing without moving becomes attractive enough that moving probabilities no longer depend on Δr. Lastly, we find that mortgage lock-in attenuates household responsiveness to shocks to employment opportunities, measured as MSA-level wage growth and instrumented with a shift-share instrument. The responsiveness of moving rates to wage growth is half as large for households who are more locked in (below-median Δr) than for those who are less locked in. We provide causal estimates of mortgage lock-in effects, highlighting unintended consequences of monetary tightening with long-term fixed-rate mortgages on mobility and labor markets.Lu Liu, The Demand for Long-Term Mortgage Contracts and the Role of Collateral.Abstract: Long-term fixed-rate mortgage contracts protect households against interest rate risk, yet most countries have relatively short interest rate fixation lengths. Using administrative data from the UK, the paper finds that the choice of fixation length tracks the life-cycle decline of credit risk in the mortgage market: the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio decreases and collateral coverage improves over the life of the loan due to principal repayment and house price appreciation. High-LTV borrowers, who pay large initial credit spreads, trade off their insurance motive against reducing credit spreads over time using shorter-term contracts. To quantify demand for long-term contracts, I develop a life-cycle model of optimal mortgage fixation choice. With baseline house price growth and interest rate risk, households prefer shorter-term contracts at high LTV levels, and longer-term contracts once LTV is sufficiently low, in line with the data. The mechanism helps explain reduced and heterogeneous demand for long-term mortgage contracts.Steffen Andersen, Cristian Badarinza, Lu Liu, Julie Marx, Tarun Ramadorai (2022), Reference Dependence in the Housing Market, American Economic Review, 112 (10), pp. 3398-3440.Abstract: We quantify reference dependence and loss aversion in the housing market using rich Danish administrative data. Our structural model includes loss aversion, reference dependence, financial constraints, and a sale decision, and matches key nonparametric moments, including a ""hockey stick"" in listing prices with nominal gains, and bunching at zero realized nominal gains. Households derive substantial utility from gains over the original house purchase price; losses affect households roughly 2.5 times more than gains. The model helps explain the positive correlation between aggregate house prices and turnover, but cannot explain visible attenuation in reference dependence when households are more financially constrained.Jack Fisher, Alessandro Gavazza, Lu Liu, Tarun Ramadorai, Jagdish Tripathy (Under Revision), Refinancing Cross-Subsidies in the Mortgage Market.Abstract: In household finance markets, inactive households can implicitly cross-subsidize active households who promptly respond to financial incentives. We assess the magnitude and distribution of cross-subsidies in the mortgage market. To do so, we build a model of household mortgage refinancing and structurally estimate it on rich administrative data on the stock of outstanding UK mortgages in June 2015. We estimate sizeable cross-subsidies during this sample period, from relatively poorer households and those located in less-wealthy areas towards richer households and those located in wealthier areas. Our work highlights how the design of household finance markets can contribute to wealth inequality.Description: Revise & Resubmit, Journal of Financial Economics.Lu Liu, Non-Salient Fees in the Mortgage Market.Abstract: This paper studies supply-side product pricing when consumers underreact to non-salient fees. Using comprehensive data on issued and offered mortgages in the UK, I document that lenders differ substantially in the fees they charge, and that borrowers appear less overall cost-sensitive to products with fees. In order to distinguish from demand factors such as unobservable preferences or product characteristics, I show that lenders pass on firm-specific funding cost shocks via fees, but not interest rates, consistent with strategic pricing of fees, and maintaining competitive prices in the salient price dimension, interest rates. I further find heterogeneity in pricing across lenders: those who rely on high fees tend to have higher funding cost, lower return on equity and larger branch networks, in line with a specialization equilibrium in which high-cost lenders are able to match with less cost-sensitive consumers.

Sean Myers and Ricardo De la O, Which Subjective Expectations Explain Asset Prices?.Abstract: We present a method for determining whether errors in expectations explain asset pricing puzzles without imposing assumptions about the mechanism of the error. Using accounting identities and survey forecasts, we find that errors in expected long-term inflation and short-term nominal earnings growth explain price variation, return predictability, and the rejection of the expectations hypothesis for aggregate stock and bond markets. Errors in expected short-term inflation and long-term nominal earnings growth play no role. The relevant errors are consistent with mistakes about both the persistence of forecasted variables and the response to surprises. A fundamental extrapolation model successfully replicates these findings.Sean Myers, Sovereign Debt, Government Spending Cycles, and Back-loaded Pension Reforms.Abstract: This paper studies the effect of public pension obligations on a sovereign government's commitment to repaying debt. In the model, the government can renege on its pension promises but suffers a cost from losing the trust of households about future pensions. Large pension promises act as a commitment device for debt because they require the government to have regular access to credit markets. The government's decision to default is driven by its total obligations, not just its debt. Thus, there is a range of pension obligations large enough to act as a commitment device without raising total obligations to the point of default. This otherwise deterministic economy has an endogenous cycle in which periods of high spending and increasing debt are followed by periods of pension reform and debt reduction. The model successfully produces high debt in excess of 100% GDP without default and back-loaded pension cuts that match salient features of recent reforms in six EU nations.Sean Myers, Public Employee Pensions and Municipal Insolvency.Abstract: This paper studies how municipal governments jointly manage spending, credit market borrowing, and public employee pensions. I model governments as levered investors who must meet non-defaultable pension obligations and may value government spending more than citizens. I quantify the model using California city-level data, including a new record of fiscal emergencies, tax increases required to maintain essential services. After the financial crisis depleted pension funds, cities engaged in excessive risk-taking: the fiscal emergency option encouraged gambling for resurrection that kept cities vulnerable to shocks well into the recovery. Restricting risk-taking does not correct this problem, but a spending cap does.Sean Myers, Ricardo De la O, Xiao Han, The Return of Return Dominance: Decomposing the Cross-Section of Prices.Abstract: Are stock valuation ratios mainly informative about future earnings growth or future returns? Using a variance decomposition, we find that over 70% of cross-sectional variation in price-earnings ratios is reflected in cross-sectional differences in future returns, while less than 30% is reflected in cross-sectional differences in future earnings growth. This is because, empirically, valuation ratios primarily predict future returns and only modestly predict future earnings growth. Additionally, changes in predicted future returns are more important than changes in predicted future earnings growth for explaining innovations in price-earnings ratios and current realized returns. We reconcile these results with previous literature which has found a strong relation between prices and future profitability. These results are consistent with models in which the cross-section of stock valuation ratios is driven mainly by discount rates or mispricing rather than differences in future earnings growth.Sean Myers and Ricardo De la O (2021), Subjective Cash Flow and Discount Rate Expectations, Journal of Finance.Abstract: Why do stock prices vary? Using survey forecasts, we find that cash flow growth expectations explain most movements in the S&P 500 price-dividend and price-earnings ratios, accounting for at least 93% and 63% of their variation. These expectations comove strongly with price ratios, even when price ratios do not predict future cash flow growth. In comparison, return expectations have low volatility and small comovement with price ratios. Short-term, rather than long-term, expectations account for most price ratio variation. We propose an asset pricing model with beliefs about earnings growth reversal that accurately replicates these cash flow growth expectations and dynamics.

Rachel Arnett is an Assistant Professor of Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She is in the Organizational Behavior subgroup with the Management Department and specializes in diversity, identity, inclusion, intergroup relations, and intersectionality. She is a Claude Marion Endowed Faculty Scholar and, in 2022, she was named by Poets & Quants as one of the Best 40-Under-40 MBA Professors.
Rachel’s research investigates pathways to developing diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as relationships across differences, including how individuals navigate identity-based differences, push for social change, confront bias and discrimination, engage in allyship behaviors, and leverage identities and role models to attain leadership success. In one stream of research, she examines when, why, and how individuals express or conceal identity-based differences (e.g., race, nationality, social class) when interacting with people who differ from themselves, and the consequences for employees’ psychological, interpersonal, and professional outcomes. Another research stream illuminates how organizational DEI goals can be advanced by better leveraging the benefits and counteracting the risks that individuals associate with diversity, equity, and inclusion. This includes understanding the important role of psychological safety for advancing DEI. A third line of work tests how individuals can overcome challenges associated with confronting bias and engaging in effective allyship. Finally, using an intersectional lens, she explores how the interplay between gender, race, and social class influence individuals’ role models and leadership trajectories.
Rachel conducts her research using a combination of laboratory experiments, surveys, and qualitative data. She has partnered with multiple organizations who are interested in advancing DEI, including conducting field experiments, employee surveys, and in-depth interviews.
Rachel completed her doctoral training in Harvard University’s Organizational Behavior program, an interdisciplinary program between Harvard Business School and Harvard’s Social Psychology department. Before Harvard, she was a Research Assistant in New York University’s Social Psychology department and a Senior Brand Strategist in the advertising industry. She received her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania.

Research

My research is driven by the following question: what can organizations and their leaders do to unite people in spite of all that divides them? I examine topics such as (1) how employees cope with intergroup hostility in constructive ways and (2) how leaders establish a common purpose. Recently I have begun to focus on how to overcome the role of distance in dividing people, especially temporal distance (what encourages people to care about the long-term consequences of their actions) and physical distance (what encourages people to help those who live and work far away from them). I investigate unanswered questions, such as why leaders sometimes take actions that backfire (for example, attempting to resolve conflict but then inadvertently escalating it) as well as how leaders can avoid these unintended consequences by helping people channel their effort and expertise toward a common vision.

Professor Samir Nurmohamed’s research focuses on how people endure, respond and persist when experiencing adversity at work.
His research spans two key streams of research related to adversity: one on workplace motivation, primarily focusing on underdogs and the impact of expectations, and another on behavioral ethics, investigating how employees respond to the adversity of unethical behavior in their organizations. For example, most existing research shows that others’ low expectations are detrimental to the performance of employees and groups within organizations, but he is interested in understanding why and when individuals can derive motivation and even achieve success when others question their capacity to succeed or treat them poorly. He has conducted his research using multiple methods in contexts such as leaders and employees in Fortune 500 corporations, job seekers at reemployment centers, and entrepreneurs seeking to bring new culturally contentious initiatives to the marketplace. His work has been published in academic journals such as the Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Psychological Science and featured in practitioner outlets such as the New York Times, Harvard Business Review, The Athletic, and NPR’s Hidden Brain.

Professor Tyler Wry studies hybrid ventures, which are organizations that combine related, but potentially contradictory aims in their core. For example, many nanotechnology startups are organized around the joint pursuit of scientific discovery and technology commercialization, and social enterprises work to generate profits while simultaneously addressing societal issues. These organizations have the potential to generate important commercial and social innovations, but also face a number of unique challenges, particularly in the startup stage of development. Building on this, Tyler’s research focuses on how hybrids emerge, attract resources, and positively affect society.

Professor Meyer’s most recent research has focused on the study of biases that arise in consumer communication.  This work includes the use of natural-language processing tools to study how sensationalist news stories develop and spread on social media platforms, and how warnings messages are  perceived by residents faced with natural disaster threats.  For example, Professor Meyer and his colleagues have been able to show that failures of  preparation that often precede catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina, Sandy, and the 2008/09 housing and equities collapse are consistent with a number of hard-wired biases in how people respond to risk. This includes a tendency for people to fail to learn as much as they should from near-misses, and under-invest in instruments whose value can only be realized in the long run.  These ideas form the basis of his recent book, co-authored with Howard Kunreuther,  the Ostrich Paradox: Why we under-prepare for Disasters.
At Wharton Professor Meyer has served as chair of the Marketing Department and  Vice Dean of Wharton’s doctoral programs.

Technological developments of measurement instruments over the past two decades have granted firms, policy makers and researchers the access to individual-level data of unprecedented granularity and scale. Digital footprints of online behavior provide comprehensive measurements of attitudes toward content, language use and information search. Emerging biomedical innovations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genotyping and hormonal assays quantify the building blocks of the biological processes that shape our preferences, cognition and decision-making. Gideon Nave studies how these technological developments may advance efficiency, productivity and innovation, and evaluate the ethical challenges that they give rise to. To this end, he develops theories and methods that allow businesses and policy makers to focus their efforts in a more targeted fashion, with the premise of better addressing the needs of their customers and delivering the right products, services and messages to the right people, at the right time. He also assesses the unique threats that such technologies might impose on consumer autonomy and privacy.
Nave’s research was published in top academic journals such as Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Management Science, Nature Human Behaviour, the Journal of Marketing and Journal of Marketing Research.

I am currently the Zhang Jindong Professor of Operations, Information and Decisions at the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School.  My central research area is on the relationship between information technology and productivity and the factors that affect the value of IT investments. Most of my recent work has been the study of complementary factors, such as organizational design and human capital, on the value of IT. Most of this work is directed at firms in all industries, although I have become increasingly interested in IT deployment in healthcare. In recent years, we have been more extensively working on the role of the IT workforce and issues that affect the demand and wages of IT workers (such as offshoring and the H1-B visa program). I have also been extensively involved in electronic business research investigating the the nature of competition in electronic markets (such as on-line travel agents), the value proposition for alternative delivery systems (such as online retail banking), the role of switching costs in determining pricing and product strategy (as in online discount brokerage), and the effect of recommender systems on consumer behavior.
I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in information systems management and economics and data analysis.  I also teach the undergraduate core class in OPIM in the Fall (off-season).
In my spare time, I also consult and conduct research into the design of IT outsourcing agreements, methods for evaluating IT investments, and other questions at the intersection of information systems, economics and econometrics. I also occasionally serve as an expert witness for information technology and consumer-related litigation (intellectual property, consumer behavior in computers and consumer electronics industries, enterprise software, and software project problems).

 Christine Chou, Steven O. Kimbrough, Frederic H. Murphy, John Sullivan-Fedock, Jason Woodard (2013), On Empirical Validation of Compactness Measures for Electoral Redistricting and Its Significance for Application of Models in the Social Sciences, Social Science Computer Review, forthcoming.Abstract: Use of optimization models in science and policy applications is often problematic because the best available models are very inaccurate representations of the originating problems. Such is the case with electoral districting models, for which there exist no generally accepted measures of compactness, in spite of many proposals and much analytical study. This paper reports on an experimental investigation of subjective judgments of compactness for electoral districts. The experiment draws on a unique database of 116 distinct, legally valid districting plans for the Philadelphia City Council, discovered with evolutionary computation. Subjects in the experiment displayed, in the aggregate, remarkable agreement with several standard measures of compactness, thus providing warrant for use of these measures that has heretofore been unavailable. The exercise also lends support to the underlying methodology on display here, which proposes to use models based on subjective judgments in combination with algorithms that find multiple solutions in order to support application of optimization models in contexts in which they are only very approximate representations.Steven O. Kimbrough and Frederic H. Murphy (2013), Strategic Bidding of Offer Curves: An Agent-Based Approach to Exploring Supply Curve Equilibria, European Journal Operational Research, in press.Abstract: We model a market in which suppliers bid step-function offer curves using agent-based modeling. Our model is an abstraction of electricity markets where step-function offer curves are given to an independent system operator that manages the auctions in electricity markets. Positing an elementary and computationally accessible learning model, Probe and Adjust, we present analytic results that characterize both the behavior of the learning model and the properties of step-function equilibria. Thus, we have developed a framework for validating agent-based models prior to using them in situations that are too complicated to be analyzed using traditional economic theory. In addition, we demonstrate computationally that, by using alternative policies, even simple agents can achieve monopoly rewards for themselves by pursuing more industry-oriented strategies. This raises the issue of how participants in oligopolistic markets actually behave. ",Male,steven_o_kimbrough.jpg

I am (somehow) the Dorothy Silberberg Professor of Applied Statistics. I am also a Professor of Operations, Information, and Decisions, and am being sued for defamation. I teach an MBA course called Managerial Decision Making. I have two primary areas of research.
In my normal job, I investigate the psychology of judgment and decision-making, with an emphasis on understanding and fixing the errors and biases that plague people’s judgments, predictions, and choices. In this research, my (excellent) co-authors and I have contributed to our understanding of advice taking, algorithm aversion, anchoring effects, consumer rating systems, forecasting biases, the illusion of control, intuitive biases, optimistic biases, outcome bias, and the wisdom of crowds.
I am better known for my work in the area of research methods. With Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, I have spent much of the past 13 years trying to identify and fix research practices that contribute to (1) the publication of false-positive research findings, and (2) to a perverse incentive structure that rewards bad research more than good research. In these efforts, we have exposed p-hacking as a major cause of the problem, started a blog devoted largely to advancing the credibility of published research (http://datacolada.org/), worked to expose cases of outright fraud (e.g., https://datacolada.org/98 and https://datacolada.org/109), developed a statistical tool designed to assess whether a selection of studies contains evidential value (www.p-curve.com), designed a pre-registration website that has been used by thousands of researchers (https://aspredicted.org/), designed a new website that makes it very easy to post and access materials and data (https://researchbox.org/), and conducted systematic replications of published findings (https://datacolada.org/81).

Sophie Calder-Wang and Paul Gompers (2021), And the Children Shall Lead: Gender Diversity and Performance in Venture Capital, Journal of Financial Economics, 142 (1).Abstract: Given the overall lack of gender diversity in the venture capital and entrepreneurship industry shown in Calder-Wang and Gompers (2017) we ask: What promotes greater gender diversity in hiring? Does diversity lead to better firm performance and higher investment returns? In this paper, using a unique dataset of the gender of venture capital partners’ children, we find strong evidence that when partners have more daughters, the propensity to hire female partners increases. Moreover, our instrumental variable results suggest that increased gender diversity improves deal and fund performance. Lastly, the effects are primarily driven by the gender of senior partners’ children.Sophie Calder-Wang and Ariel Pakes (Under Review), Unobserved Heterogeneity, State Dependence, and Health Plan Choices.Abstract: We provide a new method to analyze discrete choice models with state dependence and individual-by-product fixed effects and use it to analyze consumer choices in a policy-relevant environment (a subsidized health insurance exchange). Moment inequalities are used to infer state dependence from consumers’ switching choices in response to changes in product attributes. We infer much smaller switching costs on the health insurance exchange than is inferred from standard logit and/or random effects methods. A counterfactual policy evaluation illustrates that the policy implications of this difference can be substantive.Sophie Calder-Wang (Working), The Distributional Impact of the Sharing Economy on the Housing Market.Abstract: I estimate the welfare and distributional impact of the home-sharing platform Airbnb on New York City renters. I develop a structural model of an integrated housing market with two novel features. First, in addition to the traditional long-term rental market, absentee landlords can reallocate their housing units to the newly available short-term rental market. Second, residents can directly host short-term visitors, increasing housing utilization. Overall, renters in NYC suffer a welfare loss of $2.4 billion, where losses from increased rents dominate gains from hosting. Moreover, the increased rent burden falls most heavily on high-income, educated, and white renters. By characterizing winners and losers, this paper provides a framework for evaluating the impact of such technological innovations.Sophie Calder-Wang and Paul Gompers (Working), Diversity and Performance in Entrepreneurial Teams.Abstract: We study how diversity affects the performance of entrepreneurial teams by exploiting a unique experimental setting in which over 3,000 MBA students participated in a business course to build startups. First, we quantify how selection based on shared personal characteristics contributes to the lack of diversity. Next, when teams are formed through random assignment, we estimate that greater team diversity leads to poorer performances. However, when teams are formed voluntarily, the negative performance effect of diversity becomes greatly alleviated. Lastly, teams with more female members perform better when their faculty advisor is female. These findings suggest that policy interventions to improve diversity should consider the process by which teams are formed, as well as the role of mentoring, to achieve its intended performance goals.Sophie Calder-Wang, Paul Gompers, Patrick Sweeney (Working), Venture Capital’s Me Too Moment.Abstract: In this paper, we document the under-representation of women in the venture capital sector. We find that the high-profile Pao v. Kleiner Perkins gender discrimination trial likely had dramatic effects on the hiring of women in venture capital: firms with higher exposure to the trial, measured by their home states’ Google search interest in the trial and their network connectivity to Kleiner Perkins based on shared investments, experienced larger increases in the hiring of female venture capital investors. We provide additional evidence that the impact of the trial is concentrated on the venture capital sector, and that these changes do not appear correlated with other contemporaneous social movements. Lastly, we show that the fraction of venture-backed founders who are female also increased after the Pao trial, with both male and female venture capitalists increasing their investments in female founders. These findings are consistent with the notion that the Pao gender discrimination lawsuit has increased the awareness of gender issues in venture capital, leading to changing hiring practices and spillover changes in investment decisions.
